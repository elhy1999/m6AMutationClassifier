> The model weights for the final selected model (i.e. Random Forest model) is not pushed to this repo. This is because the file size of the model weights is too large. You can download the model weights from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TmZGTOkJuheoFeME6UdAgjgMNgutHFuv/view?usp=drive_link)

# Welcome to `/model`!
This folder consists of the saved models which we explored. The first model is the **autoencoder model**, which unfortunately, did not produce the results that we hoped for. The second model is the **random forest model**. Both models are further explained in the `/notebooks` directory, which contain information about our findings discovered during the course of the project.
