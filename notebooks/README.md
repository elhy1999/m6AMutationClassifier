# Data Science Project Repository

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that are part of our RNA modifications detection project. The notebooks cover various aspects of the machine learning pipeline including data analysis, feature extraction, model building, and evaluation.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into different folders, each containing notebooks relevant to specific tasks within the project:

### Notebooks

#### Autoencoder

- `Ernest_Method.ipynb`: This notebook includes an implementation of an autoencoding model using the "Autoencoder Method". We named it "Ernest Method" since Ernest, our group memeber suggested it.

#### Data Analysis

- `Analysis_with_PCA.ipynb`: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to the dataset to identify the most important features and reduce dimensionality.

- `Data_Parsing.ipynb`: Techniques for unzipping, processing and parsing the raw data into a structured format are demonstrated here.

- `Dataset_Normalization.ipynb`: Normalization techniques to scale the features in the dataset are applied here.

- `EDA.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to summarize the main characteristics of the data with visualizations.

- `Feature_Extraction.ipynb`: Methods for extracting meaningful features from the dataset to improve model performance are detailed here.

#### Random Forest

- `Model_Evaluation.ipynb`: Evaluation metrics and methods are used to assess the performance of the Random Forest models.

- `Naive_RF_Model.ipynb`: Construction and training of a baseline Random Forest model with default parameters.

- `Naive_RF_Prediction_Pipeline.ipynb`: A pipeline for making predictions with the Naive Random Forest model, including preprocessing steps.
